# AI Implementation Technologies  
## Project Ideation & Presentation Task

### Objective  
You will prepare and present a set of **5 project ideas** that can be developed into a **final-year Computer Vision graduation project**.  
This exercise will help you explore potential directions, identify available datasets, and connect our course topics (data processing, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc.) with real-world problems.

---

### Task Description  

1. **Think of 5 distinct computer vision project ideas** that could realistically be developed into a full implementation project.  
   Each idea should be:  
   - Technically feasible for your current skill level.  
   - Solvable using available public datasets (Kaggle, Google Dataset Search, etc.).  
   - Relevant to real-world or industrial needs.  
   - Possible to deploy as a web service (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Docker).  

2. **Prepare a short PowerPoint presentation (+8 slides)** that includes:

   | Section | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | Slide 1 | **Title** — “AI Implementation Technologies: Project Ideation” + your name |
   | Slide 2 | **Brief Introduction** — your interests or domains you like (e.g., health, agriculture, transport) |
   | Slides 3–7 | **Five project ideas** — one per slide, each slide should include:<br> - Problem description<br> - What data you would use (dataset name/source)<br> - Expected AI method (e.g., object detection, segmentation, classification)<br> - Expected output and potential application<br> - Why you think it’s interesting or impactful |
   | Slide 8 | **Reflection** — which project seems most promising and why you might choose it |

3. **During next session**, you will:
   - Present your slides briefly (7 - 10 minutes).
   - Discuss which idea you plan to continue with.
   - Receive feedback to refine your final project direction.

### Submission & Evaluation
- **Deliverable:** PowerPoint presentation (`.pptx`)
- **Deadline:** 30.October
- **Presentation time:** 7-10 minutes per student

| Criterion | Description | Points |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Creativity & relevance | Originality and societal/industrial relevance | 3 |
| Technical feasibility | Realistic to implement with available tools | 3 |
| Clarity of presentation | Logical, clear, well-structured slides | 2 |
| Dataset suitability | Real dataset identified or easy to collect | 2 |
| **Total** |  | **10 pts** |

### Outcome
By the end of this exercise, each student will have:
- 5 potential project ideas.
- 1 selected project to develop for the final implementation phase.
